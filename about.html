 I still remember the day I stumbled across FreeCodeCamp. I was scrolling through forums, feeling stuck in a career that didn’t spark joy. Programming had always fascinated me, but it seemed intimidating—like a world reserved for mathematical geniuses. I didn’t even know where to begin.
   A Leap into the Unknown. The website’s promise was simple: Learn to code for free, at your own pace. With hesitation, I signed up and started with the Responsive Web Design certification. The clear structure was the first thing that drew me in. Lessons were bite-sized and approachable, breaking down complex concepts like HTML and CSS into digestible chunks.
