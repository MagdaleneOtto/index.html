<p>I still remember the day I stumbled across FreeCodeCamp. I was scrolling through forums, feeling stuck in a career that didn’t spark joy. Programming had always fascinated me,<br> but it seemed intimidating—like a world reserved for mathematical geniuses.</br> I didn’t even know where to begin.</p>
   <h2>A Leap into the Unknown.</h2> The website’s promise was simple: Learn to code for free, at your own pace. With hesitation, I signed up and started with the Responsive Web Design certification. The clear structure was the first thing that drew me in. Lessons were bite-sized and approachable, breaking down complex concepts like HTML and CSS into digestible chunks.The first moment of triumph came when I built my first webpage. It was basic—just a personal portfolio with clunky colors and unaligned text—but it was nice. I felt a bit happy i was able to create a website.
<h3>As I progressed, the challenges got tougher.</h3>

CSS was a hurdle. There were days when I spent hours debugging only to find out I had missed a semicolon. Frustration crept in, but the supportive FreeCodeCamp community kept me going.
I discovered the forums, where people from around the world shared advice, encouragement, and solutions. The collaborative spirit was incredible. Slowly, concepts like functions, arrays, and APIs began to click.
